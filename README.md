# The Monkees project
![alt text](assets/images/preview.png)
The Monkees project is focused on the 1960’s rock band whose goal is to increase business value by engaging with their potential customers via the Internet. Therefore, the project takes shape of a front-end website that highlights features such as media players, availability calendar and gateway to the social media channels. The main purpose of the features in this project is not only to achieve business goals but also to satisfy user needs, hence to ensure positive user experience (UX).
# UX
In order to build good UX it is necessary to identify business goals and to determine user needs. Therefore, this section gives an insight into the aforementioned aspects, which in turn helps to specify features for this project.
### Business goals:
As specified by the bands representatives during the interviews their business goals are:
* To enable existing and future fans to see and hear their clips.
* To showcase their music albums.
* To create gateway to their social media channels.
* To publicise their availability to perform. 
### User needs:
As a user who is looking for a band for an event, I want to :

* see and hear band’s music clips, so that I could decide whether I like their performance.
* contact someone, so that I could ask questions such as pricing, availability etc.
* see the band’s availability to perform, so that I could immediately know whether the band is available for the required dates.
* know what other people think about the band’s performance.


As a user who has decided to book the band, I want to:
